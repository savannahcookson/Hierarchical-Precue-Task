# Hierarchical Precue Task
Source code for the Hierarchical Precue Task (HPT, in prep), written using PsychoPy.

## Task Description

The HPT combines a canonical precuing design with a match/nonmatch judgment task and a hierarchical response mapping structure. 

Participants make judgments on pairs of stimuli, each of which has a continuous value along four feature dimensions (color, shape, vertical position, horizontal position). The values for each feature can each be judged as one of two high-level categories: color can be cool or warm; shape can be concave or convex; vertical position can be above or below the midline; and horizontal position can be either close to the center or toward the outer edges of the screen. These feature dimensions are in turn categorized as spatial (vertical and horizontal position) and object-based (color and shape). 

One feature from each category has responses on each hand, such that the left hand responds to one spatial and one object-based feature and the right hand responds to the other. The two judgment categories for each feature dimension are then mapped to different finger responses on each hand. On a given trial, the stimulus pair will match along one and exactly one dimension only. Participants respond to the trial by selecting the appropriate response according to their learned mapping structure. 

On each trial, participants first see a cue, followed by a jittered inter-trial interval, and finally the stimulus pair for that trial, at which time they are instructed to make their response as quickly and accurately as possible.
